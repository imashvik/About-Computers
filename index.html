<p style="font-size:36px;color:red;">A computer is an electronic device that takes input from the user and processes data under the control of a set of instructions. It can process both numerical and non-numerical calculations. A computer can manipulate information, store, retrieve, and process data. The term "computer" was originally given to humans who performed numerical calculations using mechanical calculators. Most computers rely on a binary system that uses two variables, 0 and 1, to complete tasks.</p>
<h1>First Generation (1940–1956)</h1>
<p style="font-size:28px;" >Characterized by vacuum tubes and punched cards. ex-ENIAC,UNIVAC</p>
<h1>Second Generation (1956–1963)</h1>
<p style="font-size:28px;"> Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, allowing smaller and more efficient computers. The second generation of computers consists of two types of devices, transistors, and magnetic core. The transistors helped to develop a better computer than the first generation computers consisting of vacuum tubes.</p>
<h1>Third Generation (1964–1971)</h1>
<p style="font-size:28px;">Integrated circuits (ICs) replaced transistors, leading to smaller and faster computers and  allowed them to be shrunk down to be as small as large toasters.</p>
<h1>Fourth Generation (1971–Present)</h1>
<p style="font-size:28px;">Microprocessors. A microprocessor is a computer processor for which the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit (IC), or a small number of ICs. The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). The IC is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations.[1] The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results (also in binary form) as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic, and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.</p>
<h1>Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond)</h1>
<p style="font-size:28px;">Artificial Intelligence. SI (ultra large scale integration) technology is used in this generation of computers.
Natural language processing is now in its fifth phase of development.
Artificial intelligence has progressed.
Parallel processing has advanced on these computers.
The fifth-generation computer includes more user-friendly interfaces and multimedia functions.</p>
